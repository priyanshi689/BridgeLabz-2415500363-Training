🧠 My Java Learning Journey @ Bridgelabz

Welcome to my Java Training Repository — a hands-on record of my learning journey at Bridgelabz!
Each branch in this repo focuses on a different Java concept, taking me from core fundamentals to modern Java programming techniques like Lambda Expressions, Functional Interfaces, and Exception Handling.

🗂️ Repository Overview

💡 Each branch is a learning milestone covering a focused Java topic:

🌿 Branch Name	📘 Description
java-core	🔰 Covers Java basics — syntax, data types, loops, arrays, strings, and logic building
java-oops	🧩 Deep dive into OOP — classes, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, encapsulation
packages-in-java	📦 Organizing code using packages, imports, and modular design
wrapper-class	🧱 Understanding Wrapper Classes, Autoboxing & Unboxing
functional-interface	⚙️ Learning Functional Interfaces, Default & Static methods, and their use with Lambdas
error-and-exception	🚫 Mastering Exception Handling, including custom & built-in exceptions
lambda-expression	🌀 Real-world applications using Lambda Expressions and functional-style programming
