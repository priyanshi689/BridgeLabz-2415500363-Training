🧠 A Complete Java Learning Journey — from Basics to JDBC Integration!

This repository documents my Java training journey under the Bridgelabz Training Program, aligned with the GLA University LDP (Lecture Delivery Plan – 3rd Semester).
Each branch represents a milestone — exploring Java concepts from Core Programming to Object-Oriented Design, Collections, and Database Connectivity.

🌿 Repository Structure
🌱 Branch	📘 Description
java-core	Covers Java fundamentals — syntax, data types, loops, arrays, strings, and basic logic building.
java-oops	Focuses on Object-Oriented Programming — classes, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation.
packages-in-java	Explains how to structure and import Java code efficiently using packages.
wrapper-class	Demonstrates Wrapper Classes, Autoboxing, and Unboxing.
functional-interface	Introduces Functional Interfaces, Default/Static methods, and their integration with Lambdas.
lambda-expression	Implements real-world examples using Lambda Expressions for concise, modern Java coding.
error-and-exception	Focuses on Exception Handling — try, catch, finally, throw, and throws, including custom exceptions.
collection-framework	Explores the Java Collections Framework — Lists, Sets, Maps, and Generics.
jdbc	Connects Java with MySQL using JDBC, covering CRUD operations and database best practices.
🗓️ Weekly Java Learning Progress
August 11–13, 2025 — Getting Started! 💻

Installed Git Bash, explored Git vs GitHub.

Practiced essential Git commands: init, add, commit, push, clone.

Solved basic Java problems to sharpen logical thinking.

August 18–20, 2025 — Java Fundamentals 🔤

Learned Java structure, keywords, data types, and variables.

Practiced simple input/output and flow-based programs.

August 25–27, 2025 — Flow Control & Arrays 🔁

Studied loops (for, while, do-while), conditionals (if-else, switch).

Learned 1D and 2D arrays — declaration, initialization, traversal.

Performed matrix operations and nested loop problems.

September 1–3, 2025 — Methods & Strings 🧩

Defined and invoked methods; practiced modular coding.

Explored immutable Strings and mutable alternatives (StringBuffer, StringBuilder).

Compared performance and use-cases.

September 8–10, 2025 — Diving into OOP 🌟

Learned OOPs pillars: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction.

Explored constructors, static vs instance variables, and access modifiers.

September 15–17, 2025 — Advanced OOPs 🔍

Practiced Method Overloading/Overriding, Interfaces, and Abstract Classes.

Understood Upcasting and Downcasting with examples.

September 22–24, 2025 — OOP in Action ⚙️

Solved real-world problems using all OOP concepts together.

Wrote modular and reusable class-based programs.

October 13–15, 2025 — Functional Java 💡

Mastered Interfaces and introduced Functional Interfaces.

Learned Lambda Expressions and Default/Static methods in interfaces.

Wrote compact, clean code using Lambdas.

October 27–29, 2025 — Packages, Exceptions & Wrappers 🧰

Created and imported Java Packages.

Studied Exception Handling — built-in & custom exceptions.

Practiced Wrapper Classes, Autoboxing, and Unboxing.

Integrated all topics into a mini practice project.

November 10–12, 2025 — 💾 JDBC Meets Collections!

📍 The Week Everything Connected — Literally!

During this period, I developed a real-world Student Management Project that seamlessly integrated JDBC and Collections — bringing together everything I’d learned so far.

🔧 Project: Student Management System (Branch: jdbc/studentjdbc)

📅 Date: November 10, 2025
📂 Repo: studentjdbc on GitHub

🎯 Objective:
To create a console-based application that performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student records using MySQL (via JDBC) and manages data in-memory using Java Collections.

🧱 Core Features:

Database Integration: Connected Java with MySQL using DriverManager, Connection, Statement, and PreparedStatement.

CRUD Operations:

Add a new student record

View all students

Update existing records

Delete students by ID

Collections Usage:

Fetched database data into List<Student> and Map<Integer, Student> for manipulation.

Implemented search, sorting, and filtering features using Collections.

Exception Handling:

Graceful handling of SQL and user input errors.

Used custom exceptions like StudentNotFoundException.

Code Structure:

Student.java — Model class for student details

StudentDAO.java — Handles database operations

StudentService.java — Business logic and in-memory data management

Main.java — Menu-driven interface for user operations

🚀 Learning Highlights:

Bridged Collections Framework with Database Connectivity.

Practiced clean coding, modularization, and error handling.

Understood real-world application flow: Java → Database → Java Collections → Output.

Strengthened understanding of Git branching and commit discipline.

🧰 Tools Used

🧩 Java JDK 25
🧠 IntelliJ IDEA
🐙 Git & GitHub — Version Control
🗄️ MySQL — Database Connectivity
